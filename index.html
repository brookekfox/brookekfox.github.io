          <div class="bio-text">Hailing from the distant lands of Arizona and Texas, Matthew and Mike forged their writing partnership as fellow assistants in the fiery depths of a talent agency. Together they have worked in management, production, television development and new media. They have also recently placed in the Austin Film Festival, Bitch List, BlueCat Screenplay Competition, and Script Pipeline Writing Competition. Interesting fact, Matthew's father escaped Communist-Era Poland as a teenager, and Matthew witnessed the fall of the Berlin Wall as a baby. Just as interesting, Mike watches a lot of TV.</div>
